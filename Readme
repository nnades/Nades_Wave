Prerequests:
The program runs on Linux using Python3.5.


The input file is passed as a parameter to the main.sh script, and exported to the
environment variable via 'export' command.


Steps:
1. Download the Nades_Wave.tar.gz file to a folder.
2. Untar the file using command: 
tar xvfz Nades_Wave.tar.gz
3. Change the file permissions inside the folder (e.g. chmod 755 *).
4. Call ./main.sh to start the program.
    e.g. ./main.sh sample.csv


Outputs:
The program will create a file called "past_reports.txt" - which prevents from
running the report again.

Firefox was used to open the report automatically after execution is complete.
